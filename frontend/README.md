This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory with the Firebase credentials used by the app. The following variables are required:

```bash
FIREBASE_API_KEY=
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

Refer to your Firebase project settings for the values of each variable.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# with npm
npm run dev

# with pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
